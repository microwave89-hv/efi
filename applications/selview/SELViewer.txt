G. INSTRUCTIONS TO END USER


*	The server needs to be updated with the appropriate latest FRUSDR package. 
        The SDR repository is essential in translating SEL entries to a readable SEL description.

*	Do not modify the HRS.ini file.  Any modifications to this file may cause unpredictable behavior of the SEL Viewer utility.  

*	If the SDR record is not found for a SEL event combination (Sensor Type, 
	Generator ID and Sensor number) , the utility will display  sensor type and number instead of the name field, 
	and the SEL Viewer will display sensor reading and threshold reading values as "unspecified".

*	If the SEL Viewer utility cannot find the description string for a SEL 
	event combination (sensor type, offset, evd1, evd2 and evd3), the utility displays the event description for that event as "Unknown Event". 

*	If the event description for the given SEL event is more than 256 characters:
		- Only up to 256 characters will be displayed in the event description 
         	  column of the GUI.
		- The bottom window will show the complete event description.

*	The HR_SEL.log file contains the information on Type 02 SEL events 
	that could not be decoded.  This file is created in the same folder where SEL Viewer application is running

*       In case of OEM events, Utility decodes events of type C0, C1 and Microsoft OEM events of type 0xDC, 0xDD & 0xDE.

* 	SEL Viewer decodes only the events complying with IPMI 1.5 and 2.0 specifications.

*       Third-party brands and names are the property of their respective owners.
