Overview
========================================
PassMark's MemTest86 is a standalone memory testing software for x86 computers.
MemTest86 boots from a CD and tests the RAM in your computer for 
faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns.
<For more details see the MemTest86 User Guide>


Requirements
========================================
- x86 System (Mac and PC)
- CD drive


Creating a bootable CD
========================================

1) Insert a CD into the CD drive.
2) Use the CD burning software available on your system to create a CD-ROM using the uncompressed ISO image

Be sure that you create a CD image from the ISO file rather than placing a copy of the ISO file onto a data CD. 
Look for “Burn Image from File” or similar option under the File menu of your CD burning software. On a Mac, 
you can use 'Disk Utility'.


Booting the MemTest86 CD
========================================
The MemTest86 bootable CD supports dual booting on UEFI and BIOS platforms. 
Most newer systems are able to run the UEFI version of MemTest86.
On machines that don't support UEFI, the older V4 BIOS release of MemTest86 
will be automatically booted.

To boot from the drive you may need to go into your BIOS settings and
alter your boot order. Or launch the boot menu at system startup.
The methods for doing this will vary depending on your motherboard.

To start MemTest86 insert the CD into the appropriate drive and restart your computer.
If running on a UEFI system, the UEFI BIOS must be configured to boot from the device 
that MemTest86 is installed on. Most systems have an optional boot menu that is enabled 
by pressing a key at startup (often ESC, F9, F11 or F12).

If available use the boot menu to select the correct drive. 
You may see both the UEFI and BIOS as separate options. 
Please consult your motherboard documentation for details.

On a Mac, you need to hold down the 'c' key while the computer is booting to boot from CD. 
To boot from USB, you need to hold down the ALT / Option key on the Mac keyboard 
while powering on the machine.
