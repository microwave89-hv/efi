This document describes some specifics of the FWPIAUPD Utility  
Version 4.0.2 release. This utility is used for updating 
the boot block, operational code and PIA for various micro-controllers 
on a given platform through the use of platform - specific Intel hex
programming files and binary image files.

The Firmware and PIA Flash Update Utility (FWPIAUPD) updates the boot block, 
operational code and PIA on the BMC or an IMM module, or sends commands 
through the BMC to update another controller on the IPMB. After the code 
is updated, it is compared with the code from the hex file to make sure 
the write was done correctly.  Finally, the controller is put back into 
operational mode.

The utility supports the firmware update using the HEX file or BIN file having version
2 / version 3 of PIA header.

Dependencies
------------

A. Platform supported: S5500 and S5520 platform series and S3420GP, QSSC-S4R platform series.
   Environment Supported: WinPE 1.5/1.6, WinPE 2.0,2.1, UEFI 2.0
 
Important Notes

A. -b, -o and -pia will update only selected areas.
B. -u will do only update. Use -v to verify.
C. RMM3 will be autodetected and updated when opcode update of BMC firmware is selected.

Important Notes
---------------

A. Supported command line arguments on a system with an IMM module

* -ni
* -(u)pload
* -(i)nventory
* -address=XX
* -errlog=file
* -nodownrev

B. Documentation
----------------

- FWPiaUpdate confirms to EPS revision 2.4 as it is.

C. Examples for a system update.

For inventory
a. fwpiaupd -i
b. fwpiaupd -i -address=2c
c. fwpiaupd -i hsc.hex
d. fwiaupd -i bmc.ima -bin

For non-interactive mode
a. BMC image file Firmware update: 
   fwpiaupd -u -b -o -pia -bin bmc.ima -ni
b. ME Firmware update : 
   fwpiaupd -u ME-dib.bin -bin -ni
c. HSC Firmware update : 
   fwpiaupd -u -b HSC.hex -ni
d. LCP Firmware update : 
   fwpiaupd -u -o LCP.hex -ni

For interactive mode
a. fwpiaupd or fwpiaupd -bin

For help
b. fwpiaupd -h

Installation
------------
WinPE 2.x
Installation of drivers on windows
a. Execute install.cmd

Uninstallation 
a. Execute uninstall.cmd

Note:- Do not reboot after installation. Use WinPE customization procedure
on WinPE 1.5/1.6.

EFI
1. No seperate installation steps required. Binary files can be
	copied and executed from any location.



Errata Items
------------

A. Unsupported Functionality
* Verification of ME firmware not supported.
* Verification of Firmware without update can result in verification failure.
  This is expected behavior based on firmware used. For BMC PIA
  area cannot be verified independently. HSC Boot block verification without
  an update is also not supported.
* BIN / HEX files without DIB information is not supported for updating any firmware.
* LCP firmware boot area update not supported.
* The maximum path name for an input file is 255 including the file name.

B. Known issues
* While updating BMC Firmware in force boot mode, 
  FWPIAUPD utility displays an error message at the end of update.
  This message can be ignored as the update is successful.
* FWPIAUPD utility uses BMC USB unterface to update only if the OS populates the
  USB interface and the support drivers are loaded correctly by OS.
* Use Intel IPMI driver in case of any communication failure with Microsoft IPMI driver.
  Command to Install Intel driver is "DeviceSetup -v install imbdrv.inf *IMBDRV".
* Firmware update will be slower while using Microsoft IPMI driver interface due
  to buffer size limitation.



Changes Since Last Release:
---------------------------
 1. Fix for HSC update issue on EFI on QSSC-S4R platform series.
