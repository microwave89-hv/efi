*************************************************************************************
                 Standard Update Procedure from the embedded EFI Shell
*************************************************************************************

- Unzip the contents of the update package and copy all files to a folder on a USB flash drive
- Insert the USB flash drive to any available USB port on the server system to be updated
- Boot the Server to the EFI shell.  This can be accessed via the <F2> BIOS setup utility during POST.
- Run the command "map -r" in the EFI shell to mount the USB flash drive
- Run the command "fs0:" to change folders to the USB flash drive. The USB flash drive 
may also mount to fs1: depending on  other installed devices. The number of "fs#" is 
dependent on the result of command "map -r"
- Change folders to the folder storing the update package files
- Run the command "Startup.nsh" to start updating all the firmware and BIOS updates


Warning: 
!!Do NOT reboot or remove power from your system during the update process.
Doing so may render your system inoperable. !!


-----  Verifying updates
-  Reboot the system
-  During POST, hit the <F2> Key when prompted to access the BIOS Setup Utility
-  Hit the F9 key to load BIOS Defaults
-  At the MAIN menu verify the BIOS revision is correct
-  Move cursor to the SERVER MANAGEMENT Menu
-  Move cursor down to the SYSTEM INFORMATION Option and hit Enter
-  Verify the BMC Firmware revision is correct
-  Verify the SDR revision is correct
-  Verify the ME Firmware revision is correct
-  Hit the F10 Key to save changes and Exit


The System Software Update is Complete.


*************************************************************************************
Alternate Update Procedure:   Individual Firmware Update Procedure
*************************************************************************************

If you want to update firmware components individually, like BMC/BIOS/ME/FRUSDR, 
do NOT run the "STARTUP.NSH" file described in the Standard Update Procedure above.  
Instead, run the individual .NSH script file for each update included in the update 
package files. Follow the update order below to ensure a trouble free update:

  1) BMC firmware update
  2) BIOS update
  3) Manageability Engine (ME) Firmware update
  4) FRUSDR update


---- Update BMC Firmware

1) Boot the system to the EFI shell and go to root folder
2) At the shell prompt, run "UpdateBMC.nsh" to start BMC Firmware update
3) When complete, go to the BIOS update section described below, or power off the 
   system and cycle AC power before continuing.


---- Update System BIOS 

1) Boot the system to the EFI shell and go to root folder
2) At the shell prompt, run "UpdateBIOS.nsh" to start BIOS update
3) When complete, reboot the system and enter BIOS Setup by pressing the F2 Key during
   POST 
4) Verify the BIOS string on main BIOS menu
5) Press F9 to load defaults and press F10 to save and reset the system
6) Go to the ME firmware update section described below
The BIOS update is complete. Either reboot the server or go to the ME firmware Update section 
described below.


---- Update ME Firmware

1) Boot the system to the EFI shell and go to root folder
2) At the shell prompt, run "UpdateME.nsh" to start ME firmware update
3) When complete, go to the FRUSDR update section described below, or power off the 
   system and cycle AC power before continuing.

   

---- Update FRUSDR

1) Boot the system to the EFI shell and go to root folder
2) At the EFI command prompt, run "UpdateFRUSDR.nsh" to start FRUSDR update
3) Answer questions and enter desired information when prompted.
4) When complete, reboot the system by front control panel


---- Verifying updates


- Reboot the server  
- During POST, hit the <F2> Key when prompted to access the BIOS Setup Utility
-  Hit the F9 key to load BIOS Defaults
-  At the MAIN menu verify the BIOS revision is correct
-  Move cursor to the SERVER MANAGEMENT Menu
-  Move cursor down to the SYSTEM INFORMATION Option and hit Enter
-  Verify the BMC Firmware revision is correct
-  Verify the SDR revision is correct

*******************************************************************************
BIOS Recovery Process
*******************************************************************************
In the unlikely event the BIOS is corrupted, leaving the system in an 
unbootable state, it may be necessary to perform the following BIOS Recovery 
procedure.  

1.  Copy the following BIOS update files to the root directory of a USB media 
device (Recovery Media):
Note: These specific files will be located in the "BIOS Recovery Files" folder 
included in the System Update Package.

- IPMI.EFI 
- IFlash32.EFI 
- RML.ROM 
- R##.##.####REC.CAP (where ##.##.#### = BIOS revision number) 
- STARTUP.NSH (modified to support BIOS recovery)


2.  Power OFF the system

3.  Locate the BIOS Recovery Jumper on the server board and move the jumper 
block from pins 1-2 (default) to pins 2-3 (recovery setting)

4.  Insert the recovery media into any available USB port on the back of 
the server
Note: The front panel USB ports may not work for this procedure on some server 
systems.

5.  Power ON the system

6.  The system will automatically boot into the embedded EFI Shell

7.  The STARTUP.NSH file automatically executes and initiates the flash update.
When complete, the IFlash utility will display a message

8.  Power OFF the system and return the BIOS Recovery jumper to its default 
position

9.  Remove recovery media from the USB port

10. Power ON the system 

11. Do *NOT* interrupt the BIOS POST during the first boot.
