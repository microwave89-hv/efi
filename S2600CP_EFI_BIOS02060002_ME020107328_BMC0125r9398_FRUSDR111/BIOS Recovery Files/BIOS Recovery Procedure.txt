BIOS Recovery Procedure
*******************************************************************************


In the unlikely event the BIOS is corrupted, leaving the system in an 
unbootable state, it may be necessary to perform the following BIOS Recovery 
procedure.  

1.  Copy the following BIOS update files to the root directory of a USB media 
device (Recovery Media):
•	IPMI.EFI 
•	IFlash32.EFI 
•	RML.ROM 
•	R##.##.####REC.CAP (where ##.##.#### = BIOS revision number) 
•	STARTUP.NSH – modified to support BIOS recovery
Note: These specific files will be located in the "BIOS Recovery Files" folder 
included in the System Update Package.

2.  Power OFF the system

3.  Locate the BIOS Recovery Jumper on the server board and move the jumper 
block from pins 1-2 (default) to pins 2-3 (recovery setting)

4.  Insert the recovery media into any available USB port on the back of 
the server
Note: The front panel USB ports may not work for this procedure on some server 
systems.

5.  Power ON the system

6.  The system will automatically boot into the embedded EFI Shell

7.  The STARTUP.NSH file automatically executes and initiates the flash update.
When complete, the IFlash utility will display a message

8.  Power OFF the system and return the BIOS Recovery jumper to its default 
position

9.  Remove recovery media from the USB port

10. Power ON the system 

11. Do *NOT* interrupt the BIOS POST during the first boot.
