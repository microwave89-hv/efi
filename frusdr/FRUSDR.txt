RELEASE NOTES FOR FRUSDR LOAD UTILITY VERSION 2.0.1 Build 19

This document describes some specifics of the UEFI64, EFI32 version and Windows PE(32-bit and 64-bit) version
of FRU & SDR Load Utility.


This utility is used for updating or modifying the server management
subsystem's product level Field Replacement Unit (FRU), Sensor Data 
Record (SDR) repository, displaying the System Management 
BIOS (SMB) non-volatile storage components (previously known as the Desktop 
Management Interface (DMI) non-volatile storage components).

Through the use of a configuration file, added features allow the user to
control the execution path by probing hardware, requesting user input, and 
setting tags to provide filtering of FRU and SDR data. Multiple 
FRU and SDR files may also be processed at once through the configuration file.

The FRUSDR utility fully supports IPMI 1.5 and IPMI 2.0 specifications.

 				Important Notes

A. Install
==========

a. For Windows PE(32-bit and 64-bit)

The FRUSDR Loader is meant to be used as a Windows PE application on a Microsoft 
Windows Preinstallation Environment* server. 

The frusdr utiliy requires IMBdriver to be installed as a pre-requisite. 

To install IMBdriver:
	
	1. Go to the command prompt.
	2. Change directory to the path where FRUSDR package is present.
	3. Run the following command.

install.cmd [Full path where FRUSDR Loader utility is present.]

The IMBdriver and memory map driver installation is not needed 
if the customized Windows PE CD, containing the Intel drivers is used.

Note:- If Microsoft IPMI driver is detected, Intel IMB driver
will not be installed.

The FRUSDR utility needs to be executed from the same directory, in the 
command prompt with one of the command line options below.

Normal Command Line Use:

	C:> FRUSDR /CFG MASTER.CFG

	Upon completion of programming the FRU/SDR reboot the server. 

b. For UEFI or EFI32

The FRUSDR Loader is meant to be used as an UEFI-64 or EFI32 bit application that runs 
on EFI- Shell.

The frusdr utiliy requires IPMI driver file (IPMI.efi) to be present in the 
same directory from which the utility is run. 

The FRUSDR utility needs to be executed in the EFI-Shell command prompt with 
one of the command line options below.

Normal Command Line Use:

	fs0:\> FRUSDR /CFG MASTER.CFG

Upon completion of programming the FRU/SDR reboot the server. 

   
B.  Parsing the Command Line
============================


The FRUSDR Loader utility provides the following command line options:

	Usage: 

      		/? or /h Displays usage information.
      		/d {smb,fru,sdr} Only displays requested area.
      		/cfg filename.cfg Uses custom CFG file.
      		
      	Users may alternatively use '-' instead of the '/'. 


C. Display FRU, SDR and SMB Information
=======================================


The SDR, FRU & SMB area can be displayed using the respective commands. Example 
for each of these has been listed below.

The /D FRU parameter will display the IMM module FRU area by default. To view 
other FRU areas, additional addressing information must be provided:

The /D FRU optional addresses are used to view different FRU areas, instead 
of the default displaying of the IMM module FRU.  The parameters following the 
/D FRU are in the order: NVS_TYPE, DEVICE_ID, DEV_CNTR, NVS_LUN, DEV_BUS and 
DEV_ADDRESS. The NVS LUN address and Device Controller address are optional. 
If the LUN address is used, it must start with a "L". Only LUN addresses of 0,
1, 2, & 3 are allowed. If the Controller address is used, it must start with a
"C". There are two basic ways of addressing most FRU devices, Direct Addressing
and Indirect Addressing (IMM module logical device). Using Direct Addressing, 
after the NVS type you must supply the correct Device Controller, LUN, bus and 
slave address. When using Indirect Addressing, after the NVS type only the Device 
ID (IMM module logical device) is necessary.

      Usage for Direct Addressing:
      FRUSDR /D FRU [NVS type] [dev ctlr] [lun] [bus] [addr] 
      Example for IMM module: 
      FRUSDR /D FRU IMBDEVICE C20 L00 FF 20
      
      Usage for Indirect Addressing:
      FRUSDR /D FRU [NVS type] [device id] [Slave Address]
      In the above command Slave Address is optional and used for devices like HSC, LCP etc.
      Example: FRUSDR /D FRU IMBDEVICE 00


Examples for the S5000PSL Server board:

	1. To display the SM BIOS area:
   		fs0:\> FRUSDR /D SMB  
   		C:> FRUSDR /D SMB  

	2. To display the SDRs:
   		fs0:\> FRUSDR /D SDR 
   		C:> FRUSDR /D SDR 

	3. To display the Starlake IMM module FRU:
   		fs0:\> FRUSDR /D FRU 
   		C:> FRUSDR /D FRU 

Note: 

   If your system does not display information on any particular FRU device, then 
   it probably does not contain the device.


D. Temporary Files:
===================


If you desire to create temporary files, you must use the undocumented "/tmp"
switch on the command line. When the FRUSDR Loader is executed, it 
creates temporary files that may be used to aid in recreating a problem, 
should one arise.  The FRUSDR Loader does not remove the temporary files, the
temporary files may be erased by the user after the FRUSDR Loader has 
completed.


E. Limitation:
==============


The FRUSDR utility currently doesn't support programming FRUs and SDRs on any 
mBMC systems.


F. DEPENDENCIES:
================


   1. Executes under the Windows PE/EFI command Shell.
   2. The Windows PE image on which the utility to run should have support for WMI.
   3. The IPMI driver file, IPMI.EFI should be present in the same directory as 
      the utility.
  

G. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:
=======================


   1. S5500 platform series.
   2. S5520 platform series.
   3. S3420 platform series.
  

H. Documentation:
=================


Additional information on the FRUSDR Loader utility may be found in the 
External Product Specification.
